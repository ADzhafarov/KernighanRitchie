- Create a file with text sample containing words and breaks (tabs, newlines and blanks) with known metrics (or calculated via external software)
- Feed this file to the program and compare results

Edge-cases:
	Check that trailing and leading breaks don't add up to word count
	Check that multiple consequent breaks don't add up to word count multiple times
